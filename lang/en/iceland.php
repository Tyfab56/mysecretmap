From a geological point of view, the country straddles two tectonic plates: the American plate, in the western part of the island, and the Eurasian plate, in the eastern part, which are progressively moving away from each other by 1 to 3 cm per year. In addition, it is currently above a hot spot (under the Vatnajokull glacier).",
